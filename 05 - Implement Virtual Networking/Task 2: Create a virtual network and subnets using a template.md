# Task 2: Create a virtual network and subnets using a template

In this task, you create the **ManufacturingVnet** virtual network and associated subnets.  
The organization anticipates growth for the manufacturing offices, so the subnets are sized for the expected growth.  
For this task, you use a template to create the resources.

---

## Step 1: Locate the template file
- Find the **template.json** file exported in the previous task (should be in your *Downloads* folder).
- Edit the file using the editor of your choice.  
- Many editors have a **change all occurrences** feature.  
- If you are using Visual Studio Code, ensure you are working in a **trusted window** (not restricted mode).  
- Consult the architecture diagram to verify the details.

## Step 2: Make changes for the ManufacturingVnet virtual network
- Replace all occurrences of **CoreServicesVnet** with **ManufacturingVnet**.

ðŸ“Œ Read back through the file and ensure everything looks correct.  
Use the architecture diagram for resource names and IP addresses.  
Be sure to **Save your changes**.  

> **Note:** There is a completed template file in the *lab files* directory.

## Step 4: Make changes to the parameters file
- Locate the **parameters.json** file exported in the previous task (should be in your *Downloads* folder).  
- Edit the file using the editor of your choice.  
- Replace the one occurrence of **CoreServicesVnet** with **ManufacturingVnet**.
